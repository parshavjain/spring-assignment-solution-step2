## Seed code - Boilerplate for step 2 - Activity Stream Assignment
### Assignment Step Description
In this Case Study, we will create an Activity Stream Application which accepts Sender's name and Message as input from the front end and displays the same along with the timestamp posting in a reverse chronological order (latest message first). 

Here we will have a **Message** class which will be acting as the data model for message table in the database. Please note that this class is annotated with **@Entity annotation** (**The @Entity annotation marks the class as an entity bean, so it must have a no-argument constructor that is visible with an at least protected scope**), where Hibernate will scan all the packages for any Java objects annotated with the @Entity annotation. 
If it finds any, then it will begin the process of looking through that particular Java object to recreate it as a table in your database. 

In this case study, we are defining the beans related to hibernate from inside **ApplicationContextConfig** class only. Hence hibernate-cfg.xml file and HibernateUtil class are no more required in this step.

### Problem Statement
In this case study: Activity Stream Step 2 we will create an application that requires us to implement two functionalities. They are as follows:
1. Display the list of existing messages from the database. Each message should contain senderName, message, and timestamp. 
2. The Message which is sent should contain the senderName, message, and timestamp.

### Following are the broad tasks:
1. Create the application-context for the application. 
2. Extend AbstractAnnotationConfigDispatcherServletInitializer class WebApplicationInitializer.
3. Display the list of existing messages from the database. Each message should contain senderName, message, and timestamp. send a message which should contain the senderName, message, and timestamp.
4. Implement the MessageDAO interface and annotate with @Repository annotation in MessageDAOImpl.

#### To use this as a boilerplate for your new project, you can follow these steps

1. Clone the base boilerplate in the folder **assignment-solution-step2** of your local machine
     
    `git clone https://gitlab-dev.stackroute.in/activity-stream-java/step2-boilerplate.git assignment-solution-step2`

2. Navigate to assignment-solution-step2 folder

    `cd assignment-solution-step2`

3. Remove its remote or original reference

     `git remote rm origin`

4. Create a new repo in gitlab named `assignment-solution-step2` as private repo

5. Add your new repository reference as remote

     `git remote add origin https://gitlab-wd.stackroute.in/{{yourusername}}/assignment-solution-step2.git`

     **Note: {{yourusername}} should be replaced by your username from gitlab**

5. Check the status of your repo 
     
     `git status`

6. Use the following command to update the index using the current content found in the working tree, to prepare the content staged for the next commit.

     `git add .`
 
7. Commit and Push the project to git

     `git commit -a -m "Initial commit | or place your comments according to your need"`

     `git push -u origin master`

8. Check on the git repo online, if the files have been pushed
